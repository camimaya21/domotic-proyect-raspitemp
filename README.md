# Domotic project
**Final Project in Ironhack's Web Developer Bootcamp** - A domotic system POC to control a Dakine's air conditioner + heater using Arduino Uno, Raspberry pi3 and a MEAN fullstack development (MongoDB, Express.JS, Node.JS and Angular5) 👉🏼 *Dic 2017*.

### UPDATE: 🚧 Jun 6th 2021
This proyect **will soon be archived** because is really out of date (4 years 😅) and unfortunately I'm not going to update it to the newest versions of the original MEAN stack. This repository was intended to be a simple POC. Nevertheless, I will rebuild this project with an other stack and with a different aproach, so stay tune to my github 👾
